# 1.	Introduction
Estimating the strength of concrete can help in developing safety guidelines governing the use in the construction of buildings. 
In the current project I have tried to create a model that can accurately predict the concrete strength given the composition of input materials. To do so, I have tried to replicate I-Cheng Yehâ€™s data and results using a simple neural network model in R.

# 3.	Summary
By deploying a very simple Neural Network model I was able to replicate the accuracy reported by Yeh in his paper. This demonstrates the applicability and ease with which neural networks can showcase high performance. To optimize, I had used varied degree of threshold and hidden layers and achieved a correlation of 0.82745.
